                    <p>Baisa is a popular term used in most parts of Rajasthan state in India, to address a girl or woman respectfully. To put it simply, Baisa is a woman of respect, power and authority.</p>
                    <p> We take that meaning and extend it into the concept called Baisa to refer to the contemporary woman who is redefining what being a woman means in the modern world and she is doing it with complete control, on her own terms and with absolute panache.<br>

Manju grew up to admire the zeal and craftsmanship of the women in nearby villages who create beautiful art in everyday useful products. However, she has been intrigued by the observation that these talented artisans from villages remain unknown and unrewarded for their handicraft, despite huge global demand for these products. As a result, these native arts are dying a slow yet certain deaths and the artisans have to opt for alternative vocations to keep their finances going.</p>
                    <p class="team-details">Armed with her on-the-job learning and experience of working as a partner with a leading wholesale firm for printed fabrics in Jaipur, she has developed a keen understanding of fabric, printing and various other crafts.</p>

The connection between them was instant and they hit it from the moment they started talking about how to shape Baisa. The bond between them, both personally and professionally, has only grown further and is the force behind building Baisa as a brand to reckon with. The Rolling Circle is the technology and marketing backbone of Baisa, and is one of the core forces in building it.</p>
